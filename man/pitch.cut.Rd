\usage{
pitch.cut(pitch, tStart = -Inf, tEnd = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{pitch}{Pitch object (either in Frame or Array format)}

\item{tStart}{beginning time of interval to be cut (default \code{-Inf} = cut from the \code{xmin} of the Pitch)}

\item{tEnd}{final time of interval to be cut (default \code{Inf} = cut to the \code{xmax} of the Pitch)}
}
\value{
Pitch object
}
\description{
Cut the specified interval from the Pitch object and preserve time
}
